The majority of my work current work is happening in Debian's GitLab instance [Salsa](https://salsa.debian.org) in the [Debusine](https://salsa.debian.org/freexian-team/debusine) project. You can read more about Debusine in the [documentation](https://freexian-team.pages.debian.net/debusine/).

Debusine is implemented using Django (for the server) and Python for the client side.

I have some personal side-projects:
 * [github-action-push-to-another-repository](https://github.com/cpina/github-action-push-to-another-repository): GitHub Action to push directories to another repository
 * [qdacco](https://github.com/cpina/qdacco): C++/Qt frontend for [DACCO](http://catalandictionary.org/) (since 2005)
 * [qnetload](https://github.com/cpina/qnetload): C++/Qt graphical application to measure network speeds or transmision
 * [radio-pi](https://github.com/cpina/radio-pi): C++/Qt frontend to listen to radio stations on a Raspberry pi (or any GNU/Linux desktop!)
